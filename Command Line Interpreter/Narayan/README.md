# BasicShell

This repository contains a basic shell I implemented using C.

To immerse into the world of shell, type the following in your linux terminal
'''
./shell
'''

To run the program in batchmode, type the following
'''
./shell text_file.txt
'''
where text_file is the name of your text file which contains batchmode commands.For illustration purpose, batchfile.txt is included in the repository

**Always finish the batchfile text with 'exit' command**
