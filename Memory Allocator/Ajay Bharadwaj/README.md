The memory allocator has the following functions:
- Mem_Init([Initial Size in Bytes to be Allocated])
  - Must be called before using any of the other functions
- Mem_Alloc([Size in Bytes that is Required])
  - Returns a void pointer to the allocated memory space or NULL otherwise
- Mem_Free([Pointer to the object to be freed])
  - Returns 0 if successful, -1 if the pointer does not fall within a currently allocated object
- Mem_IsValid([Pointer to the object])
  - Returns 1 if the pointer falls within a currently allocated object
- Mem_GetSize([Pointer to the object])
  - If the pointer falls within a currently allocated object, the size of the object is returned, -1 otherwise
