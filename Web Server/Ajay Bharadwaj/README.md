The server needs to be run before the client can be run

Entering the port number is only for testing purposes

Running the server:

For the port number, any integer above 1000 will work
>./server

Running the client
The port number must be the same as the one entered for the server
>./client [IP ADDRESS OF THE DEVICE TO CONNECT TO]

For running the client locally on the same device as the server
>./client localhost

Permissions can be changed using
>chmod +rwx server

>chmod +rwx clien
